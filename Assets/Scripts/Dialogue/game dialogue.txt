Final Boss (1):
Timmy...
Your gambling debt has gotten out of control.
You even sold your soul to me. And now you have nothing left to offer.
Well...
Except for your family. Hehe...


Tuxedo Boss(1):
Souless, maidenless, and childless. 
I pity a loser like you. 
But I'm not a fan of charity.
If you want to see the boss you'll have to earn it.
Have this dice.
If you're lucky you'll roll a good buff for your weapon or even debuff me.
But if it's not your day you can find yourself in a real pickle. Hehe...

Tuxedo Boss(2) Retry:
Pathetic...
Your death made me laugh so here's another die.
Be careful not to roll the dice too much though. Hehe...

Tuxedo Boss(3) Death:
Impossible!
A mere human defeated me! A gambling addict in debt!
Noooooooo!

Slimy Boss(1):
That tuxedo guy was pretty weak huh.
Your cards won't be enough to beat me!

Slimy Boss(2) Retry:
Heh. Not so tough are ya.
Have another die. I love seeing you get bad rolls.

Slimy Boss(3) Death:
Ow my eye. Not cool dude.
